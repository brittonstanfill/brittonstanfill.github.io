I teach UX Design to career professionals working to get into the field.

In a class a few weeks ago, a few of students were presenting their research on a projector, using keynote. Their presentation detailed their research and their ideation for a financial education app they were working on together.

STUDENT 1: As we were interviewing people we were really careful in the way that we asked questions. Since in our interview we were dealing with finances. We asked them questions like what do you think people do with X Y Z finacial thing.  We avoided asking them direct questions.

STUDENT 2: We felt like this would allow us to learn a lot. We worried that we would make them feel uncomfortable, people don't like talking about their finances. We thought in some cases when we asked them about things indirectly, they might feel more comfort sharing about themselves in a round about sort of way.

I asked them if in the course of their interviewees if their interviewees shared any personal stories and if they followed up with questions about their interviewee's actual behavior. They hadn't, and I explained to them that this wasn't good. And that they would need to do some more research.

It reminded me of a story another product designer told me once. The designer was working with a company that produced insulin pumps. They conducted a series of interviews that weren't yielding the insights that would help them understand how they needed to alter the product to make it work better for their customers. In a moment of inspiration, it occurred to the designer to ask about how the insulin pump affected their sex life. He went ahead and asked the immensely personal question; it changed the interview completely. They gained crucial insights that guided improvements to the product.

Not being willing to ask personal questions when we interview our users and customers prevents us from learning what we need to know to make the changes to our products that make a difference in their lives.
