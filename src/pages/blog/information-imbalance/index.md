We know our designs forward and backward and forward again. We gather quantitative and qualitative data that inform our design choices. We ideate on detail after detail in the interactions we design. We bounce ideas off of others; they bounce their ideas off of us. We conduct user tests and iterate based on what we learn. We discuss technical details with frontend and backend engineers. We know holistically about the design journey that has taken us from point A to point B.

There is an inherent imbalance in information between a designer and anyone else about their design. This imbalance is one of the reasons why it is so important to involve your team in the design process. We will get back to this point in a minute.

What are some signs that the imbalance of information has become a problem?

You are reviewing a "completed" feature with one of the talented engineers you work with, and the implementation doesn't match the vision in how it looks, feels, or functions.

Someone is asking one of your team members about a specific feature, they reply, their answer makes it evident that the two of you aren't on the same page about how the interaction is supposed to work and what it is designed to do.

After conducting a review of your final design, your engineers regretfully tell you what you've designed will not work, it isn't technically feasible right now and may not be for months or years (priorities being what they are).

As you request design changes your favorite bearded engineer flips a desk, becomes irked, or resistant.

You could start to feel resentful towards a teammate, but you would be getting angry at the wrong person. Make sure that you bring your team along with you.
