Their presentation included details about their research and some of their ideation so far for a financial education app they were working on together.</p>\n<p>STUDENT 1: As we were interviewing people we were really careful in the way that we asked questions. Since in our interview we were dealing with financials. We asked them questions like what do you think people do with X Y Z.  We avoided asking them direct questions.</p>\n<p>STUDENT 2: We felt like this would allow them to talk about themselves. And share details that otherwise, they wouldn’t have felt comfortable sharing.</p>\n<p>I asked them if in the course of the interviews their interviewees shared any personal stories and if they followed up with questions about their interviewee’s actual behavior.</p>\n<p>It reminded me of a story another product designer told me once. The designer was working with a company that produced insulin pumps. They conducted a series of interviews that weren’t yielding the insights that would help them understand how they needed to alter the product to make it work better for their customers. In a moment of inspiration, it occurred to the designer to ask about how the insulin pump affected their sex life. He went ahead and asked the immensely personal question; it changed the interview completely. They gained crucial insights that guided improvements to the product.</p>\n<p>Not being willing to ask personal questions when we interview our users and customers prevents us from learning what we need to know to make the changes to our products that make a difference in their lives.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Asking personal questions",date:"November 01, 2017",description:"Asking personal questions in interviewing can feel like the wrong choice.
